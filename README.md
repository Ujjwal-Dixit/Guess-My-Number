# Guess My Number Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented using JavaScript and HTML. The player's objective is to guess a random number generated by the computer. The game provides feedback to the player based on their guesses and keeps track of their score and high score.

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, a random number between 1 and 20 is generated.
2. Enter your guess in the input field and click the **Check** button.
3. The game will provide feedback on your guess:
   - If the guess is empty or not a valid number, it will display a "**No number!**" message.
   - If the guess is out of range (less than 1 or greater than 20), it will display an "**Out of range!**" message.
   - If the guess is too low, it will display a "**Too Low!**" message.
   - If the guess is too high, it will display a "**Too High!**" message.
   - If the guess is correct, it will display a "**Correct Number**" message and highlight the background in green.
4. Your current score is displayed at the top right of the screen. Each incorrect guess deducts one point from your score.
5. If you run out of score (score reaches 0), the game ends and the message "**Game Over!**" is displayed in red.
6. The high score is also tracked and displayed at the top left of the screen. It represents the highest score achieved in the current game session.
7. To play again, click the **Again** button. This will reset the game, generate a new random number, and restore the score to 20.

Enjoy playing the Guess My Number game!
